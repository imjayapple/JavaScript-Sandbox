This is all commented

// Data Types

// Numbers
Number: Any number, including numbers with decimals: 4, 8, 1516, 23.42

// Large numbers
BigInt: Any number, greater than 253-1 or less than -(253-1), with n appended to the number: 1234567890123456n

// Strings
String: Any grouping of characters on your keyboard (letters, numbers, spaces, symbols, etc.) surrounded
by single quotes: ' ... ' or double quotes " ... ", though we prefer single quotes. Some people like to think of string as a fancy word for text

// True False Boolean
Boolean: This data type only has two possible values— either true or false (without quotes).
It’s helpful to think of booleans as on and off switches or as the answers to a “yes” or “no” question

// Null Values
Null: This data type represents the intentional absence of a value, and is represented by the keyword null (without quotes)

// Undefined, value does not exist
Undefined: This data type is denoted by the keyword undefined (without quotes).
It also represents the absence of a value though it has a different use than null. undefined means that a given value does not exist

// New to the JS language
Symbol: A newer feature to the language, symbols are unique identifiers, useful in more complex coding. No need to worry about these for now

// Objects
Object: Collections of related data.
